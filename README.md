This is an online version of the budgeting app of the same name I wrote years ago in Java. I've decided 
to re-write it in Node so that I can access it from different devices and not always have to access the 
famiy budgeting information from a desktop or laptop computer.

The main database will be a **mariadb** instead of a simple text-file, and I will add some charting and
advanced aggregation features as the program gets built out.
